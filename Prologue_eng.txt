Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote,
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote.
And bathed every veyne in swich lickoour,
Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
Whan Zephirus eek with his sweete breeth,
Inspired hath in every holt and heeth,
The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonn,
Hath in the Ram his halve cours yronne.
And smale foweles maken melodye.
That slepen al the night with open ye.

(So priketh hem nature in hir corages),
Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages.
And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes,
To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes;
And specially from every shires ende,
Of Engelond to Caunterbury they wende.

The hooly blisful martir for to seke,
That hem hath holpen whan that they were seeke.
Bifil that in that seson on a day,
In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay.
Redy to wenden on my pilgrymage,
To Caunterbury with ful devout corage.
At nyght was come into that hostelrye,
Wei nyne and twenty in a compaignye.
Of sondry folk, by aventure yfalle,
In felaweshipe, and pilgrimes were they all.
That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde.
The chambres and the stables weren wyde.

And wel we weren esed atte beste,And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste.So hadde I spoken with hem everichon,That I was of hir felaweshipe anonn.And made forward erly for to ryse,To take oure wey ther as I yow devyse.But nathelees. whil I have tyme and space,Er that I ferther in this tale pace.Me thynketh it acordaunt to resoun,To telle yow al the condicioun;Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,And whiche they weren. and of what degree.And eek in what array that they were inne;And at a knight than wol I first biginne.
